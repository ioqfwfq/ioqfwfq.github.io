  <div class="research-overview">
    <p class="lead">
      My research integrates behavioral testing, neural recordings, and computational modeling to understand 
      how cognitive functions develop and operate across the lifespan. I focus on the neural mechanisms 
      underlying working memory and executive functions, with applications in clinical neuroscience.

      <h3>Brain Structure and Activity Predicting Cognitive Maturation in Adolescence</h3>
      <div class="project-meta">
        <span><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Vanderbilt University, Wake Forest University</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        This multilevel longitudinal study examined monkey adolescent neurocognitive development, investigating how brain structural changes affect neuronal activity that determines cognitive performance. The developmental trajectory of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex remarkably predicted working memory improvements during adolescence.

      <h3>White Matter Microstructure and Working Memory of Macaques in Adolescence</h3>
      <div class="project-meta">
      </div>
      <p>
        This study examines the relationship between white matter development and working memory improvement during adolescent maturation in macaque monkeys. Using longitudinal neuroimaging and behavioral testing, researchers tracked changes in white matter microstructure alongside cognitive performance.

      <h3>Laminar Pattern of Adolescent Development Changes in Working Memory</h3>
      <div class="project-meta">
      </div>
      <p>
        This study investigated the laminar distribution of neurophysiological changes during adolescent development in working memory, analyzing neurophysiological recordings from young and adult monkeys at different cortical depths.

        <h4>Key Discoveries:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Superficial layers exhibited increased baseline firing rate in the adult stage</li>
          <li>Substantial increases in delay period activity occurred in the middle layers after adolescence</li>
          <li>Improved discriminability of stimulus location was most evident in deeper layers</li>

      <h3>Parallel Signatures of Cognitive Maturation in Primate Antisaccade Performance</h3>
      <div class="project-meta">
      </div>
      <p>
        This study investigated cognitive development using the antisaccade task, where monkeys must resist looking toward a bright stimulus and instead look away. Researchers evaluated behavioral performance and recorded prefrontal cortex neural activity before and after puberty-to-adulthood transition.

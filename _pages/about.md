# 👨‍🔬 About Me
I am a neuroscientist with a multidisciplinary background in cognitive neuroscience, behavioral experimentation, and computational modeling. My research focuses on working memory, neural development, and brain-behavior relationships, integrating insights from nonhuman primate and human studies. I apply advanced statistical and machine learning approaches to understand how cognitive functions emerge and mature across development.
